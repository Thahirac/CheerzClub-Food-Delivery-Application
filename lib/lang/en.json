If this is not reasonably possible, Cheerzclub will indicate to the Buyer how the Buyer can view the General Terms and Conditions, which are in any case published on the Cheerzclub website, so that the Buyer can easily store these General Terms and Conditions on a durable medium.\n3.\tIn exceptional cases it is possible to deviate from these General Terms and Conditions if this has been explicitly agreed in writing with Cheerzclub.\n4.\tThese General Terms and Conditions also apply to additional, amended and follow-up agreements with the Buyer. Any general and/or purchasing conditions of the Buyer are explicitly rejected.\n5.\tIf one or more provisions of these General Terms and Conditions are partially or wholly invalid or are destroyed, the other provisions of these General Terms and Conditions will remain in force and the invalid/voided provision(s) will be replaced by a provision with the same meaning as the original provision.\n6.\tAmbiguities about the content, explanation or situations that are not regulated in these General Terms and Conditions must be assessed and explained in accordance with the spirit of these General Terms and Conditions.\n7.\tIf these General Terms and Conditions refer to they, them/theirs, this should also be understood as a reference to he/him/his and she/her/hers, if and insofar as applicable.\n\nArticle 3 - The Offer\n\n1.\tAll offers made by Cheerzclub are without obligation, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. If the Offer is limited or valid under specific conditions, this will be explicitly stated in the offer. An Offer only exists if it is recorded in writing.\n2.\tThe Offer made by Cheerzclub is without obligation. Cheerzclub is only bound by the Offer if the acceptance thereof is confirmed in writing by the Buyer within 30 days, or if the Buyer has already paid the amount due. Nevertheless, Cheerzclub has the right to refuse to enter into an Agreement with a\npotential Buyer based on a justifiable reason for Cheerzclub.\n3.\tThe Offer contains an accurate description of the Product offered with associated prices. The description is sufficiently detailed that the Buyer is able to make a proper assessment of the Offer. Obvious mistakes or errors in the Offer care not binding for Cheerzclub.

The Buyer cannot derive any rights from this mistake or error.\n6.\tIf the Buyer cancels an order that has already been confirmed, the costs already incurred will be charged to the Buyer. This also includes the transaction costs incurred, currently estimated at 0.25 euros per transaction.\n7.\tThe right of withdrawal is excluded for the Buyer for the reason that the Product must be consumed immediately, at least within 14 days, by the guest in the third-party restaurant.\n8.\tCheerzclub does not provide or sell alcoholic beverages to anyone under the age of 18. The sale is made exclusively by the affiliated restaurant, which also has the required permits. When ordering alcoholic beverages, the Buyer confirms by placing an order that they meet the legal minimum age for the purchase of these products. The Buyer undertakes that only they, or a person authorised by them for that purpose who has also reached the legal minimum age of 18 years, will receive the order.\n9.\tWhen an order for alcoholic Products or other Products to which a legal age limit applies, Cheerzclub or the relevant restaurant is obliged to ask the Buyer and/or the guest to identify themselves when delivering to the guest in accordance with the applicable law. If the Buyer and/or the guest cannot identify themselves sufficiently or do not meet the minimum age requirements, Cheerzclub will refuse to deliver the Products to the guest.\n10.\tIn the event that the guest cancels the table reservation at the third-party restaurant, the Buyer will receive a refund of any amount already paid, with the exception of the fixed cancellation fee of 0.25 euros. The Buyer will be refunded to the account number known to Cheerzclub.\n\nArticle 5 - Performance of the Agreement\n\n1.\tCheerzclub shall perform the agreement to the best of its knowledge and ability.\n2.\tIf and insofar as proper performance of the agreement so requires, Cheerzclub has the right to have certain work done by third parties.\n3.\tThe Buyer shall ensure that all information, which Cheerzclub indicates is necessary or which the Buyer should reasonably understand to be necessary for the execution of of the Agreement,is provided to Cheerzclub on time. If the information required for the execution of the execution of the Agreement is not provided to Cheerzclub on time, Cheerzclub has the right to suspend the execution of the Agreement.\n4.\tIn the execution of the Agreement, Cheerzclub is not obliged to follow the instructions of the Buyer if this changes the content or scope of the Agreement. If the instructions result in additional work for Cheerzclub, the Buyer is obliged to reimburse the additional costs accordingly.\n5.\tBefore proceeding with the execution of the Agreement, Cheerzclub may demand security from the Buyer or full payment in advance.\n6.\tCheerzclub is not liable for damage, of any nature, that has arisen because Cheerzclub has assumed incorrect and/or incomplete information provided by the Buyer, unless Cheerzclub was aware of this inaccuracy or incompleteness.\n7.\tThe Buyer indemnifies Cheerzclub against any claims of third parties that suffer damages in connection with the execution of the agreement and which are attributable to the Buyer.\n\nArticle 6 - Delivery\n\n1.\tIf the commencement, progress or delivery/completion of the Agreement is delayed because, for example, the Buyer has not supplied all the requested information or has not provided it on time, does not provide sufficient cooperation, the deposit/payment has not been received on time by Cheerzclub, or any delay is caused by other circumstances beyond Cheerzclub's control, Cheerzclub and/or the restaurant are entitled to a reasonable extension of the delivery/completion period. Any agreed delivery times are never strict deadlines. The Buyer must give Cheerzclub written notice of default and grant it a reasonable term to still be able to deliver. The Buyer is not entitled to any compensation due to the delay.\n2.\tThe guest is obliged to take delivery of the goods at the time that they are made available to it in accordance with the Agreement, even if these are offered to it earlier or later than agreed.\n3.\tIf the Buyer refuses to accept goods or defaults in terms of providing information or instructions that are necessary for the delivery, Cheerzclub is authorised to store the goods at the expense and risk of the Buyer.\n4.\tIf Cheerzclub requires information from the Buyer in the context of the execution of the Agreement, the delivery time will only commence after the Buyer has made all information necessary for the execution available to Cheerzclub.\n5.\tIf Cheerzclub has stated a term for delivery, this is indicative.\n6.\tCheerzclub is entitled to deliver the goods in parts, unless this has been deviated from in the Agreement or no independent value can be attributed to the partial delivery. Cheerzclub is entitled to invoice the goods delivered separately.\n7.\tDeliveries are only made if all invoices have been paid unless explicitly agreed otherwise. Cheerzclub reserves the right to refuse delivery if there is a justified expectation of non-payment.\n\nArticle 7 - Packaging and Transport\n\nThe Products are located in the third-party restaurant. The restaurant takes care of the actual delivery to the guest. Cheerzclub only accepts payments from Buyer, but is never involved in the actual delivery.\n\nArticle 8 - Investigation and Complaints\n\n1.\tAny visible defects or shortcomings must be reported by the guest to the relevant restaurant immediately after delivery.\n2.\tIf in accordance with the previous paragraph, the consumer files their complaint in due time, they shall still be obliged to take delivery and effect payment of the goods purchased. If the guest wishes to return defective items, this will only take place with the prior consent of the relevant restaurant.\n3.\tIf, for any reason, the guest is not present in the restaurant of the third party when the Buyer has had a Product delivered for the guest, the order will expire after 23:59 on the day of the planned presence of the guest in the third-party restaurant. From that moment on, the Buyer is entitled to a refund of amounts already paid minus transaction costs.\n4.\tRefunds to the Buyer will be processed as soon as possible, but the refund can take no later than 14 days after receipt of the Buyer's statement of dissolution. The refund will be made to the previously specified account number.\n5.\tIf and insofar as the wine or other product chosen by the Buyer is no longer in stock, the relevant restaurant is entitled to deliver a replacement item, which is equal/comparable to the Product purchased by the Buyer. Any damage suffered by the Buyer as a result of the (deviating) Product cannot be recovered from Cheerzclub and/or the relevant restaurant.\n\nArticle 9 - Prices\n\n1.\tDuring the period of validity of the Offer, the prices of the Products offered will not be increased, unless there are changes in VAT rates.\n2.\tThe prices stated in the Offer are exclusive of VAT, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n3.\tThe prices as stated in the Offer are based on the cost factors applicable at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement, such as: import and export duties, freight and unloading costs, insurance and any levies and taxes.\n4.\tIn the case of Products or raw materials of which price fluctuations on the financial market and over which Cheerzclub has no influence, Cheerzclub may offer these Products at variable prices. The Offer states that the prices are target prices and may fluctuate.\n\nArticle 10 - Payment and Collection Policy\n\n1.\tPayment should preferably be made in advance in the currency in which is invoiced through the method indicated.\n2.\tThe Buyer cannot derive any rights or expectations from a previously issued budget, unless the parties have explicitly agreed otherwise.\n3.\tThe Buyer must make a lump-sum payment to the account number and details of Cheerzclub that are made available to them. Parties can only agree on a different payment term after explicit and written permission from Cheerzclub.\n4.\tIf a periodic payment obligation of the Buyer has been agreed upon, Cheerzclub is entitled to adjust the applicable prices and rates in writing with due observance of a period of 3 months.\n5.\tIn the event of the Buyer's liquidation, bankruptcy, attachment or a suspension of payment, the seller's claims against the Buyer shall become immediately due and payable.\n6.\tCheerzclub has the right to allocate payments made by the Buyer first of all to settle costs, then to settle any overdue interest,and finally deduct it from the principal sum and the accrued interest. Cheerzclub may refuse an offer of payment without being in default, if the Buyer stipulates a different sequence for the payment allocations. Cheerzclub shall be entitled to refuse full payment of the principal sum, if said payment does not include overdue interest, the current interest and the costs.\n\nArticle 11 - Warranty\n\nCheerzclub guarantees that the Products comply with the Agreement, the specifications stated in the Offer, usability and/or reliability and the legal rules/regulations at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement, except for any replacement products if it appears that the Product chosen by the Buyer is not available. In such case, the guest will receive a replacement and equivalent Product.\n\nArticle 12 - Products Instructions for Use\n\n1.\tThe Buyer and/or guest of Products must follow Cheerzclub's regulations and instructions.\n2.\tThe legal minimum age applies when consuming alcoholic beverages. The Buyer and/or guest is responsible for enforcing the relevant legislation upon delivery.\n3.\tAlcohol can be a risk to human health, any statements of Cheerzclub and/or the relevant restaurant and its representatives, such as \"Enjoy in moderation\" and \"NIX18\" should therefore never be interpreted as medical advice.
